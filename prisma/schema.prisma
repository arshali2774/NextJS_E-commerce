// "model products" is changed to "model Product".
// Since our collection name is called products because it contains many product, but in our app we want operation to be called upon "product" and not "products".
// For e.g. product.findOne() and not products.findOne().
// We have changed the model name and make it capitalize.
// Now we have to tell which collection it is connected to.
model Product {
  id          String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  description String
  imageURL    String
  name        String
  price       Int
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  // we can do that by using the "@@map" function and specifying the collection here.
  @@map("products")
}

// now we are going to push it in using "npx prisma db push"
// genrate prisma client - npx prisma generate
// now we can talk with our database
